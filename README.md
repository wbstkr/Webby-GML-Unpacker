# gml_compiler

If you don't feel like using gm82, it can be daunting to edit really long .gml files. gml_compiler splits .gml files into separate scripts so that it is easier to manage. When you've made your edits, you can recompile it back to the original .gml file.

## Running the Code

Please download gml_compiler.py or [gml_compiler.exe](https://github.com/wbstkr/gml_compiler/releases/) and place it into the directory containing your .gml file.

If you're using the .py file, run the command `python gml_compiler.py`

If you're using the .exe file, just run the application.
